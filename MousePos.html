  Errors: 
    unnecessary hashes in span element names
    no jquery library added, which is necessary to use $ to access elements
    no event argument in updateXY function definition (needed to access event.pageX, event.pageY)
    distance is calculated from the upper left corner since that is coordinate (0,0)

  <p>The mouse is located at position (<span id="xPos"></span>, <span id="yPos"></span>), and is <span id="dist"></span> pixels from the lower-left corner.</p>

<!--Added JQuery library, based on the usage of $ symbol to access elements-->
