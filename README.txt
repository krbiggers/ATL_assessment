Dino Biggers - take home project submission

To run this project, you will need Python v3.9

First, use this github repo link to clone the repository locally: 
git@github.com:krbiggers/ATL_assessment.git

Dependencies: 
You will need to install the following packages (which are included in the file requirements.txt) all with the latest available stable version
- Flask
For data visualization/manipulation: 
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- openpyxl

You can install all of these using this command in the terminal: 
pip install -r requirements.txt

And run the project by running this in the terminal: 
python app.py

And navigate to the local server the terminal outputs. 

From there, you can navigate to the corrected MousPos.html file at the top of the page. You can also search or browse through hitters and pitchers to view individual metrics calculated based on the dataset given. 
Navigating to a hitter's page will display their hitting spraychart (calculated based on hit distance and exit direction), a video of their hardest recorded hit, and a few other metrics. There was not as much individual information on pitchers, so there is just a little bit of relevant individual data on each pitcher's page.
Underneath the search bars for hitters and pitchers, there is a short, surface level analysis of correlation among the data and how we can use these correlations to predict the outcome of a batted ball.
